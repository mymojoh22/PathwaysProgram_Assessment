# PathwaysProgram_Assessment

This small project was based on an assessment given by corporate HR as part of the first interview. The premise is as follows:

Assume:
1. You are working with the CHRO of IBM to draft the 2021 diversity goals for enterprise. You have the headcount file for IBM and the New Hire file. Please share your data analysis, approach and the overall diversity % target basis the same. What's the story you would tell about this data? Share whatever other assumptions you make.

2. Share a root cause analysis based on your observations.

3. Share your recommendation plan for IBM to reach the diversity target you stated.
